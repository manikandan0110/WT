                The Industry Institute Partnership Cell is established for promoting and nurturing the Industry Linkages for the Institute in the year 2002 with Grant- in- aid from AICTE, New Delhi. The cell was awarded ‘A’ Excellent grade in 2003 by the review team. The Grants, in three installments of Rs. 8 lakh , Rs.2 lakh and 1 lakh , were received in 2002, 2003 and 2006 . The IIPC is presently fully self supporting.
            </p>
            
            <p>The IIPC operates as a separate unit in the Institute and managed by a Chief Coordinator (CCO, an experienced senior faculty from one of the departments) who is appointed by the College Principal. He is assisted by the individual department coordinators nominated by the respective departmental heads.</p>
            
            <p>The departments are given revenue targets in the beginning of the academic year in a meeting wherein the Principal, Chief Coordinator, Heads and coordinators of the departments participate. The performance of the cell is continuously monitored in the bi-monthly review meetings by the CCO with the other department coordinators as well as in the bi-monthly meeting of the HOD-s with Principal.</p>
            
            <p>IIP Cell is undertaking Testing, Training, Consultancy and Energy auditing activities for Industries at nominal charges. The testing activities are directly handled by the departments and consolidated monthly activity lists and revenue reports are submitted to the Cell. The other activities are undertaken with prior scrutiny by the IIP cell and with the approval of the Principal.</p>
            
            <p>All the three revenues are credited into a separate IIPC Grant-in Aid Account. Out of the total net revenue, to encourage the consultancy work of concerned faculty and the non-teaching staff certain percentage of earnings are distributed.</p>
            
            <p>The cumulative revenue earned by the IIPC activities from 2002 to till date is more than Rs. 5.17 crores.</p>
